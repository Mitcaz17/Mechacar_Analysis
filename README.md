*Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Looks like the vehicle length and ground clearance give us the most accurate amount of data regarding on how these affect the MPGs of the vehicle. 

*Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The Slope does not seem to be zero since it does contain a value.


*Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Its does, by taking into account different aspects of the car it paint a picture on how the car will permform.
